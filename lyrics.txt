Very superstitious, writings on the wall,
Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall,
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass,
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past. When you believe in things that you don't understand,
Then we suffer,
Superstition ain't the way. Very superstitious, wash your face and hands,
Rid me of the problems, do all that you can,
Keep me in a daydream, keep me goin' strong,
You don't want to save me, sad is my song. When you believe in things you don't understand,
Then you suffer,
Superstition ain't the way, yeh, yeh. Very superstitious, nothin' more to say,
Very superstitious, the devil's on his way,
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass,
Seven years of bad luck, good things in your past. When you believe in things that you don't understand,
Then you suffer,
Superstition ain't the way, no, no, no. No New Year's Day to celebrate
No chocolate covered candy hearts to give away
No first of spring, no song to sing
In fact here's just another ordinary day No April rain
No flowers bloom
No wedding Saturday within the month of June
But what it is, is something true
Made up of these three words that I must say to you I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart No summer's high
No warm July
No harvest moon to light one tender August night
No autumn breeze
No falling leaves
Not even time for birds to fly to southern skies No Libra sun
No Halloween
No giving thanks to all the Christmas joy you bring
But what it is, though old so new
To fill your heart like no three words could ever do I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart I just called to say I love you
I just called to say how much I care, I do
I just called to say I love you
And I mean it from the bottom of my heart, of my heart, of my heart Isn't she lovely
Isn't she wonderful
Isn't she precious
Less than one minute old
I never thought through love we'd be
Making one as lovely as she
But isn't she lovely made from love
Isn't she pretty
Truly the angel's best
Boy, I'm so happy
We have been heaven blessed
I can't believe what God has done
Through us he's given life to one
But isn't she lovely made from love
Isn't she lovely
Life and love are the same
Life is Aisha
The meaning of her name
Londie, it could have not been done
Without you who conceived the one
That's so very lovely made from love You are the sunshine of my life
That's why I'll always be around,
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart I feel like this is the beginning,
Though I've loved you for a million years,
And if I thought our love was ending,
I'd find myself drowning in my own tears, whoa oh oh ah You are the sunshine of my life,
That's why I'll always stay around, mmm mmm yeah yeah
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart You must have known that I was lonely,
Because you came to my rescue,
And I know that this must be heaven,
How could so much love be inside of you?
Whoa oh oh oh You are the sunshine of my life, yeah,
That's why I'll always stay around,
You are the apple of my eye,
Forever you'll stay in my heart. You are the sunshine of my life, baby,

That's why I'll always stay around Call up, ring once, hang up the phone
To let me know you made it home
Don't want nothing to be wrong with part-time lover
If she's with me I'll blink the lights
To let you know tonight's the night
For me and you, my part-time lover We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right If I'm with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by, don't even speak
Know the word's "discreet" when part-time lovers
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek, its really you my part-time lover We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day, lovers by night
Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right I've got something that I must tell
Last night someone rang our doorbell
And it was not you, my part-time lover
And then a man called our exchange
But didn't want to leave his name
I guess that two can play the game
Of part-time lovers
You and me, part-time lovers
But, she and he, part-time lovers As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may
Just as hate knows love's the cure
You can rest your mind assure
That I'll be loving you always As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow
But in passing will grow older every day
Just as all that's born is new
You know what I say is true
That I'll be loving you always (Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)
Always
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)
Always
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)
Always
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream) Did you know that true love asks for nothing
No no her acceptance is the way we pay
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee
To last through forever and another day Just as time knew to move on since the beginning
And the seasons know exactly when to change
Just as kindness knows no shame
Know through all your joy and pain
That I'll be loving you always As today I know I'm living
But tomorrow could make me the past
But that I mustn't fear
For I'll know deep in my mind
The love of me I've left behind
'Cause I'll be loving you always (Until the day is night and night becomes the day)
Always
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)
Always
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)
Always
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)
Did you know you're loved by somebody
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)
Always
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)
I'll be lovin' you forever
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)
Always
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)
Always
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)
Always mm mm We all know sometimes life hates and troubles
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it
You're not helpin' to make this earth
A place sometimes called hell
Change your words into truths
And then change that truth into love
And maybe our children's grandchildren
And their great grandchildren will tell
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky You know it doesn't make much sense
There ought to be a law against
Anyone who takes offense
At a day in your celebration 'Cause we all know in our minds
That there ought to be a time
That we can set aside
To show just how much we love you And I'm sure you would agree
It couldn't fit more perfectly
Than to have a world party
On the day you came to be Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday I just never understood
How a man who died for good
Could not have a day that would
Be set aside for his recognition 'Cause it should never be
Just 'cause some cannot see
The dream as clear as he
That they should make it become an illusion And we all know everything
That he stood for time will bring
For in peace our hearts will sing
Thanks to Martin Luther King Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday Why has there never been a holiday, yeah
Where peace is celebrated
All throughout the world The time is overdue
For people like me and you
Who know the way to truth
Is love and unity to all God's children It should never be a great event
And the whole day should be spent
In full remembrance
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people So let us all begin
We know that love can win
Let it out don't hold it in
Sing it loud as you can Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Ooh yeah
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday We know the key to unify all people
Is in the dream that you had so long ago
That lives in all of the hearts of people
That believe in unity
We'll make the dream become a reality
I know we will
Because our hearts tell us so Happy birthday
Happy birthday
Happy birthday
... Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Oo baby, here I am, signed
Sealed delivered, I'm yours Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Oo baby, here I am, signed
Sealed delivered, I'm yours Here I am baby
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(Signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours)
I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
Hey, hey, yea, yea, didn't I, oh baby Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touched them they did nothing, girl
Oo baby, here I am, signed
Sealed delivered, I'm yours, oh I'm yours Ooo babe you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you are my only desire
Ooo baby, here I am, signed
Sealed delivered, I'm yours Here I am baby
Oh, you've got the future in your hand
(Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby

I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean
I could be a broken man but here I am With your future, got your future babe

Here I am baby
(Signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours)
Here I am baby

Still signed
(Signed)
Sealed, delivered
(Sealed, delivered)
I'm yours, yeah Music is a world within itself
With a language we all understand
With an equal opportunity
For all to sing, dance and clap their hands
But just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove
But you can tell right away at letter A
When the people start to move They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people
They can feel it all over
They can feel it all over people Music knows it is and always will
Be one of the things that life just won't quit
But here are some of music's pioneers
That time will not allow us to forget
For there's Basie, Miller, Sachmo
And the king of all Sir Duke
And with a voice like Ella's ringing out
There's no way the band can lose You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over
You can feel it all over people
You can feel it all over Over time, I've been building
My castle of love
Just for two, though you never
Knew you were my reason
I've gone much too far
For you now to say
That I've got to throw my castle away Over dreams, I have picked out
A perfect come true
Though you never knew it was
Of you I've been dreaming
The sandman has come from too far away
For you to say come back some other day And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over love, over me Over heart, I have painfully
Turned every stone
Just to find, I had found what
I've searched to discover
I've come much too far for me now to find
The love that I sought can never be mine And though you don't believe that they do
They do come true
For did my dreams
Come true when I looked at you
And maybe too, if you would believe
You too might be
Overjoyed, over love, over me And though the odds say improbable
What do they know
For in romance
All true love needs is a chance
And maybe with a chance you will find
You too like I
Overjoyed, over love, over you,
Over you Everyone's feeling pretty
It's hotter than July
Though the world's full of problems
They couldn't touch us even if they tried
From the park I hear rhythms
Marley's hot on the box
Tonight there will be a party
On the corner at the end of the block Didn't know you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I bet you nobody ever told you
That you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
You would be jammin' and jammin' and jammin' jam oh They want us to join their fighting
But our answer today
Is to let all our worries
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away
Peace has come to Zimbabwe
Third World's right on the one
Now's the time for celebration
'Cause we've only just begun Didn't know you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you
That you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Bet you nobody ever told you that you
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
I know nobody told you that you Would be jammin' until the break of dawn (we're in the middle of the makin's)
(Of the master blaster jammin')
But gonna jammin', jammin', jammin' You ask me am I happy
Well as matter of fact
I can say that I'm ecstatic
'Cause we all just made a pact
We've agreed to get together
Joined as children in Jah
When you're moving in the positive
Your destination is the brightest star You didn't know you
(We're in the middle of the makin's)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn (of the master blaster jammin')
Bet you nobody ever told you that you (We're in the middle of the makin's)
Would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Oh, you would be jammin' until the break of dawn
Don't you stop the music, no no
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
I bet you if someone approaches you
Yesterday to tell you that you would be jammin' you would not believe it
Because you never thought that you would be jammin' oh, oh, oh, oh
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
Oh, oh, oh, you may as well believe what you are feeling
Because you feel your body jammin'

(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin')
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the master blaster jammin') Oh yeah baby, like a fool I went and stayed too long

Here I am baby, (here I am baby)
Here I am baby (signed, sealed delivered, I'm yours) I see us in the park
Strolling the summer days of imaginings in my head
And words from our hearts
Told only to the wind felt even without being said
I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's somethin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
There's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
Knocks me off my feet I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
More and more
We lay beneath the stars
Under a lovers tree that's seen through the eyes of my mind
I reach out for the part
Of me that lives in you that only our two hearts can find
But I don't want to bore you with my trouble
But there's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet
But there's sumptin 'bout your love
That makes me weak and
Knocks me off my feet I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling I don't want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
I don't' want to bore you with it
Oh but I love you, I love you, I love you
Darling I don't want to bore you with it Looking back on when I
Was a little nappy headed boy
Then my only worry
Was for Christmas what would be my toy
Even though we sometimes
Would not get a thing
We were happy with the
Joy the day would bring
Sneaking out the back door
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine
Greeted at the back door
But thought I told you not to go outside
Tryin' your best to bring the
Water to your eyes
Thinkin' it might stop her
From woopin' your behind
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
'Cause I love them so
Brother says he's tellin'
'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl
Just don't tell I'll give you
Anything you want in this whole wide world
Mama gives you money for Sunday school
You trade yours for candy after church is through
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the wall
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right
But while you were doin'it-it sure felt outta sight
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go
I wish those days could come back once more
Why did those days ever have to go For once in my life I have someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me
Somehow I know I'll be strong For once I can touch, what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Oh someone warm like you
Would make my dream come true, yeah yeah (For once in my life) For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before (Not like it's hurt before) For once I have someone I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore (I'm not alone anymore) For once I can say
This is mine you can't take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me (Someone who needs me) Hey hey hey, yeah (Someone who needs me)
Oh baby, Lord baby (For once in my life) For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it's hurt me before (Not like it's hurt before) For once I have something I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore (I'm not alone anymore) For once I can say
This is mine you can't take it
As long as I know I have love I can make it
For once in my life I have someone who needs me (Someone who needs me)
For once in my life (Someone who needs me)
Somebody that needs me (Someone who needs me) Oh baby, for once in my life People keep on learnin'
Soldiers keep on warrin'
World keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long Powers keep on lyin'
While your people keep on dyin'
World keep on turnin'
'Cause it won't be too long I'm so glad that he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin'
Till I reach my highest ground Lovers keep on lovin'
Believers keep on believin'
Sleepers just stop sleepin'
'Cause it won't be too long
Oh no I'm so glad that he let me try it again
'Cause my last time on earth I lived a whole world of sin
I'm so glad that I know more than I knew then
Gonna keep on tryin'
Till I reach my highest ground Woo!
Till I reach my highest ground
No one's gonna bring me down
Oh no
Till I reach my highest ground Don't let nobody bring you down (they'll sho 'nough try)
God is gonna show you higher ground La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la My cherie amour, lovely as a summer day
My cherie amour, distant as the Milky Way
My cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine In a cafe or sometimes on a crowded street
I've been near you, but you never noticed me
My cherie amour, won't you tell me, how could you ignore
That behind that little smile I wore
How I wish that you were mine La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la Maybe someday, you'll see my face among the crowd
Maybe someday, I'll share your little distant cloud
Oh, cherie amour, pretty little one that I adore
You're the only girl my heart beats for
How I wish that you were mine La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la Lately, I have had the strangest feeling
With no vivid reason here to find
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging
'Round my mind Far more frequently you're wearing perfume
With you say no special place to go
But when I ask will you be coming back soon
You don't know, never know Well, I'm a man of many wishes, hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye Lately I've been staring in the mirror
Very slowly picking me apart
Trying to tell myself I have no reason
With your heart Just the other night while you were sleeping
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name
But when I ask you of the thoughts you're keeping
You just say nothing's changed Well, I'm a man of many wishes, I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye Oh, I'm a man of many wishes, I hope my premonition misses
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide
'Cause they always start to cry
'Cause this time could mean goodbye Sunny
Yesterday my life was filled with rain
Sunny
You smiled at me and really eased the pain Oh, the dark days are gone
And the bright days are here
My Sunny one shines so sincere
Oh, Sunny one so true
I love you Oh, Sunny
Thank you for the sunshine bouquet
Sunny
Thank you for the love you brought my way You gave to me your all and all
Now I feel ten feet tall
Sunny one so true
I love you Oh, yeah yeah Sunny
Thank you for the truth you let me see
My Sunny
Thank you for the facts from A to Z My life was torn like a windblown sand
Then a rock was formed
When you held my hand
Sunny one so true
I love you Sunny
Oh, thank you for the smile upon your face
Sunny
Thank you for the gleam that shows its grace You're my spark of nature's fire
You're my sweet complete desire
Sunny one so true
I love you I love you, yeah
Yes I do
I love you Oh so long for this night I prayed
That a star would guide you my way
To share with me this special day
Where a ribbon in the sky for our love If allowed may I touch your hand
And if pleased may I once again
So that you too will understand
There's a ribbon in the sky for our love This is not a coincidence
And far more than a lucky chance
But what is that was always meant
Is our ribbon in the sky for our love, love We can't lose with God on our side
We'll find strength in each tear we cry
From now on it will be you and I
And our ribbon in the sky
Ribbon in the sky
A ribbon in the sky for our love When was the last time
That they heard you say
Mother or father, I love you
And when was the last time
That they heard you say
Daughter or son, I love you Ones you say you cherish everyday
Can instantly be taken away
Then you'd say I know this can't be true
When you never took the time
To simply tell them "I love you" When was the last time
That they heard you say
Sister or brother, I love you
And when was the last time
That they heard you say
Darling or best friend, I love you The one for whom you'd give your very life
Could be taken in the twinkling of an eye
Through your tears you'd ask why did you go
Knowing you'd didn't always show
Just how much you loved them so These three words
Sweet and simple
These three words
Short and kind
These three words
Always kindles
An aching heart to smile inside I know a family
Who hasn't a cent to their name
And yet the joy and love they have between them
They always claim
And when one's called from life
The survived mourn the lost
And will never be the same
Yet they rejoice
In knowing they gave them their all These three words
Sweet and simple
These three words
Short and kind
These three words
Always kindles I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy
We're each other's baby, we're in love I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love She can't love me, I can't love her
Cause they say we're the wrong color
Staring, gloating, laughing, looking
Like we've done something wrong
Because we show love strong, get real, come on
Calling us names too bad to mention
But we pay them no attention
For color blind are inner feelings
If we feel happiness
And know our love's the best, forget their mess I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy
We're each other's baby, we're in love Everyone's created equal
Hell with all you ignorant people
Trying to stereo type us
You really ought to quit
Cause you don't know jack, you make us sick
Get off my jock, you're trying to ride me
Because I got my girl beside me
You'll only make yourself look stupid
I love you're trying to dis
Cause we've got happiness, I bet you're pissed I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever
We've got jungle fever, we're in love

Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty
His parents give him love and affection
To keep him strong moving in the right direction
Living just enough, just enough for the city His father works some days for fourteen hours
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny
Living just enough, just enough for the city yeah His sister's black but she is sho 'nuff pretty
Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy
To walk to school she's got to get up early
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty
Living just enough, just enough for the city Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many
His patience's long but soon he won't have any
To find a job is like a haystack needle
'Cause where he lives they don't use colored people
Living just enough, just enough for the city Living just enough for the city His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City
He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution
He tried to vote but to him there's no solution Living just enough, just enough for the city yeah, yeah, yeah! I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow
This place is cruel no where could be much colder
If we don't change the world will soon be over Living just enough, just enough for the city! I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you
I don't know why I love you

Five, four, three, two, one I was born in Lil' Rock
Had a childhood sweetheart
We were always hand in hand
I wore hightop shoes and shirt tails
Suzy was in pig tails
I know I loved her even then
You know my papa disapproved it
My mama boohooed it
But I told them time and time again
"Don't you know I was made to love her
Built a world all around her"
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey
She's been my inspiration
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years
Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossomed tenderly
My life grew sweeter through the years
I know that my baby love me
My baby needs me
That's why we made it through the years
I was made to love her
Worship and adore her
Hey, hey, hey
All through thick and thin
Our love just won't end
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!
My baby loves me
My baby needs me
And I know I ain't going nowhere
I was knee high to a chicken
And that love bug bit me
I had the fever with each passing year
Oh, even if the mountain tumbles
If this whole world crumbles
By her side I'll still be standing there
'Cause I was made to love her
I was made to live for her, yeah hey hey hey
Ah, I was made to love her
Built my world all around her
Hey, hey, hey
Oo baby, I was made to please her
You know Stevie ain't gonna leave her, no
Hey, hey, hey Like a long lonely stream
I keep runnin' towards a dream
Movin' on, movin' on
Like a branch on a tree
I keep reachin' to be free
Movin' on, movin' on 'Cause there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
There's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun Like an old dusty road
I get weary from the load
Movin' on, movin' on
Like this tired troubled earth
I've been rollin' since my birth
Movin' on, movin' on There's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun
And before my life is done
Got to find me a place in the sun You know when times are bad
And you're feeling sad
I want you to always remember Yes, there's a place in the sun
Where there's hope for everyone
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run
I know there's a place in the sun They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been wasting most their time
Glorifying days long gone behind
They've been wasting most their days
In remembrance of ignorance oldest praise Tell me who of them will come to be
How many of them are you and me
Dissipation
Race relations
Consolation
Segregation
Dispensation
Isolation
Exploitation
Mutilation
Mutations
Miscreation
Confirmation, to the evils of the world They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
They've been looking in their minds
For the day that sorrows gone from time
They keep telling of the day
When the savior of love will come to stay Tell me who of them will come to be
How many of them are you and me
Proclamation
Of race relations
Consolation
Integration
Verification
Of revelations
Acclamation
World salvation
Vibrations
Stimulation
Confirmation, to the peace of the world They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a pastime paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
They've been spending most their lives
Living in a future paradise
We've been spending too much of our lives
Living in a pastime paradise Let's start living our lives
Living for the future paradise
Praise to our lives
Living for the future paradise
Shame to anyone's lives
Living in the pastime paradise In life we have our pains and sorrows
Face mountains we think we can't climb
Nothing can there's always tomorrow
You feel like giving up, you say you're out of luck
But then you hear a voice in your mind
Telling you to Hold on to your dream
Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
'till the day that life is said and done This world is filled peaks and valleys
With rivers we think we can't cross
To busy keeping sorrows telling
You say you're at you're in
You say you never win
But then a light comes on in your mind
Till you Hold on to your dream
Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
Until the day that life is said and done If you wanna hold on to something
You better hold on to your dreams
If you want to hold on to something
You've gotta hold to your love
To your love So if they try to burst your bubble
It's cause they have none of their own
And when you feel you are in trouble
Hold your head up high and feel your heart inside
And know that you are never alone
Just as long as you Hold on to your dream
Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a father to his son
Don't let anyone ever steal your joy from you
Hold on to your dream
'till the day that life is said and done Hold on to your dream
Cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dream
Like a mother to her child
Don't let anyone ever steal your dreams from you
Hold on to your dream
And do your best to always wear a smile Hold on to your dream
cause they're always worth having
Hold on to your dreams to the end and to always weara a SMILE! TO KNOW YOU IS TO LOVE YOU
WRITERS STEVIE WONDER, SYREETA WRIGHT
Copyright 1972 To know you is to love you
But to know me is not the way you see
'Cause you made me so happy
That my love for you grows endlessly
When I'm down and feelin' sad
You always comfort me
Baby to know you is to love you
Is to see you bein' free as the wind
'Cause the power of your lovin'
Is too strong to hold within
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I think I love you
I know you and I can feel our love just growing, growing, baby
Hey doggone it baby And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe I love you And if I should ever go away
Well, then close your eyes
And try to feel the way we do today
And than if you can't remember Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowin' you can always count on me
For sure, that's what friends are for
And bad times, I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for Well, you came in lovin' me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way I thank you Oh, and then for the times when we're apart
Well, just close your eyes and know
These words are coming from my heart
And then if you can't remember, oh Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowin' you can always count on me

And bad times, I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for Mmm hmm that's what friends are for
Mmm hmm, yeah If it's magic
Then why can't it be everlasting
Like the sun that always shines
Like the poets in this rhyme
Like the galaxies in time
If it's pleasing
Then why can't it be never leaving
Like the day that never fails
Like on seashores there are shells
Like the time that always tells
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
So
If it's special
Then with it why aren't we as careful
As making sure we dress in style
Posing pictures with a smile
Keeping danger from a child
It holds the key to every heart
Throughout the universe
It fills you up without a bite
And quenches every thirst
So
If it's magic
Why can't we make it everlasting
Like the lifetime of the sun
It will leave no heart undone
For there's enough for everyone La la la la la la lala la
La la la la la la lala la
La la la la la la lala la
La la la la la la lala la For you
There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see
For you
There might be another song
But all my heart can hear is your melody
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two
For you
Love might bring a toast of wine
But which each sparkle know the best for you I pray
For you
Love might be for you to find
But I will celebrate our love of yesterday
So long ago my heart without demanding
Informed me that no other love could do
But listen did I not though understanding
Fell in love with one
Who would break my heart in two
For you
There might be another star
But through my eyes the light of you it's all I see
For you
There might be another song
But in my heart your melody will stay with me You made my soul a burning fire
You're getting to be my one desire
You're getting to be all that matters to me
And let me tell you girl, I hope and pray each day I live
A little more love I'll have to give
A little more love that's devoted and true

When we could feel
The wheel of life turn our way
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday I had a dream, so did you
Life was warm and love was true
Two kids who followed all the rules
Yester fools and now Now it seems those yester dreams
Were just a cruel and foolish game
We used to play
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday When I recall what we had
I feel lost, I feel sad
With nothing but the memory of
Oh, yester love and now Now it seems those yester dreams
Were just a cruel and foolish game
We had to play
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday
Sing it with me
Yester-me, yester-you, yesterday
One more time, yeah Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime Someday at Christmas we'll see a Man
No hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shinning moment my heart ran away
From our world today Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Hate will be gone love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart (Someday all our dreams will come to be)
(Someday in a world where men are free)
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmastime
Someday at Christmastime Baby, ev'rything is all right, uptight, out of sight
Baby, ev'rything is all right, uptight, out of sight I'm a poor man's son, from across the railroad tracks,
The only shirt I own is hangin' on my back,
But I'm the envy of ev'ry single guy
Since I'm the apple of my girl's eye
When we go out stepping on the town for a while
My money's low and my suit's out of style, But it's all right if my clothes aren't new
Out of sight because my heart is true
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, out of sight
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight She's a pearl of a girl, I guess that's what you might say,
I guess her folks brought her up that way,
The right side of the tracks, she was born and raised
In a great big old house, full of butlers and maids
She said "no one is better than I", I know I'm just an average guy, No football hero or smooth Don Juan,
Got empty pockets, you see I'm a poor man's son
Can't give her the things that money can buy
But I'll never, never, never make my baby cry, And it's all right, what I can't do,
Out of sight because my heart is true,
She says baby ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, ha ha ha ha, yeah,
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, way out of sight
Baby, ev'rything is alright, uptight, clean out of sight Lonely one of young so brokenhearted
Traveling down the rigid road of life
Using pharmaceutical extractions
To find the paradise Finds the high but comes down feeling lower
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray
Looking up to heaven for the answer
They hear a voice that says You will know, troubled heart you'll know
Problems have solutions, trust and I will show
You will know troubled heart you'll know
Every life has reason, for I made it so Single parent trying to raise their children
But they would much rather not alone
Reaches out to find that special someone
To make their house a home Finds someone but no one is the right one
Gets down on their knees and starts to pray
Looking up to heaven for the answer
They hear a voice that says You will know, lonely heart you'll know
Problems have solutions, trust and I will show
You will know, lonely heart you'll know
Every life has reason, for I made it so You'll know, troubled heart you'll know
Problems have solutions, trust and I will show
You will know troubled heart you'll know
Every life has reason, for I made it so You will know, lonely heart you'll know
Problems have solutions, trust and I will show
You will know, lonely heart you'll know
Every life has reason, for I made it so
You'll know, lonely heart you'll know Free like the river
Flowing freely through infinity
Free to be sure of
What I am and who I need not be Free from all worries
Worries prey on one self's troubled mind
Freer than the clock's hands
Tickin' way the times Freer than the meaning of free
That man defines
Life running through me
Till I feel my father God has called Me having nothin'
But possessing riches more than all
And I'm free to be nowhere
But in every place I need to be Freer than a sunbeam shining through my soul
Free from feelin' heat or knowing bitter cold
Free from conceiving the beginning
For that's the infinite start I'm gone, gone but still living
Life goes on without a beating heart
Free like a vision
That the mind of only you can see Freer than the raindrop
Falling from the sky
Freer than a smile
In a baby's sleepin' eyes I'm free like a river
Flowin' freely through infinity
I'm free to be sure of
What I am and who I need not to be I'm much freer like the meaning
Of the word free that man, man defines
Free, yeah, like the vision
That the mind of only, only you will ever see
Free like the river
My life goes on and on through infinity Seize upon that moment long ago
One breath away and there you will be
So young and carefree
Again you will see that place in time, so gold Steal away into that way back when
You thought that all would last forever
But like the weather
Nothing can ever, and be in time, stay gold But can it be when we can see
So vividly, a memory
And yes, you say, so must the day too fade away
And leave a ray of sun, so gold Life is but a twinkling of an eye
Yet filled with sorrow and compassion
Though not imagined, all things that happen
Will age too old, though gold All is fair in love
Love's a crazy game
Two people vow to stay
In love as one they say But all is changed with time
The future no one can see
The road you leave behind
Ahead lies mystery But all is fair in love
I had to go away
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair All of fate's a chance
It's either good or bad
I tossed my coin to say
In love with me you'd stay But all in war is so cold
You either win or lose
When all is put away
The losing side I'll play But all is fair in love
I should never have left your side
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair
A writer takes his pen
To write the words again
That all in love is fair Moon blue, rivers of love you shine, Bathe me in light sublime
Flood me with all your glowing heart can give
Moon blue, memories bind like chains
When will you come again
I wait in darkness just for your bright to beam 'Cause I'm not afraid of the consequence
Of being in love with you
And I'd rather be alone some nights
Awaiting your full hue
For though the sun makes bright the day
My world is dark when there's no you
You light my skies and make dark night bright day, Moon blue Moon blue, your beauty's seen by all, the yearning of your call
Travels the world and then makes home my soul
Moon blue, lift me to starry heights, I long to live within your light
Solace of mind, my heart is yours for always 'Cause I'm not afraid of the consequence
Of being in love with you
And I'd rather be alone some nights
Awaiting your full hue
For though the sun makes bright the day
My world is dark when there's no you
You light my skies and make dark night bright day, Moon blue We are amazed but not amused
By all the things you say that you'll do
Though much concerned but not involved
With decisions that are made by you But we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
You haven't done nothing It's not too cool to be ridiculed
But you brought this upon yourself
The world is tired of pacifiers
We want the truth and nothing else, yeah And we are sick and tired of hearing your song
Telling how you are gonna change right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
You haven't done nothing Jackson 5 join along with me say doo doo wop
Hey hey hey, doo doo wop
Wow wow wow, doo doo wop
Hm hm hm, doo doo wop
Co co co, doo doo wop
Bum bum bum, doo doo wop We would not care to wake up to the nightmare
That's becoming real life
But when mislead, who knows a person's mind
Can turn as cold as ice un hum Why do you keep on making us hear your song
Telling us how you are changing right from wrong
'Cause if you really want to hear our views
You haven't done nothing
Yeah, na, na, nothing Jackson 5 sing along again say doo doo wop
Hey hey hey, doo doo wop
Oh, doo doo wop
Bum bum bum, doo doo wop
Sing it, baby, doo doo wop
Bum bum bum, doo doo wop
Bum bum bum, doo doo wop
Hm-mm, sing it loud now, for your people, sing doo doo wop
Bum bum bum, doo doo wop, better come and say doo doo wop
Co co co, doo doo wop
Oh, doo doo wop
Bum bum bum, doo doo wop
Doo doo wop
Doo doo wop
Doo doo wop
Doo doo wop
Doo doo wop I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
I thought you would go then come back home
I thought the cold would leave by summer
But my quiet nights will be spent alone You said there would be warm love in springtime
That was when you started to be cold
I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find myself all alone You said then you'd be alive in autumn
Then you said you'd be the one to see the way
No, no no no no I never dreamed you'd leave in summer
But now I find my love has gone away Why didn't you stay? Packing my bags going away
To a place where the air is clean
On Saturn
There's no sense to sit and watch people die
We don't fight our wars the way you do
We put back all the things we use
On Saturn
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes There's no principles in what you say
No direction in the things you do
For your world is soon to come to a close
Through the ages all great men have taught
Truth and happiness just can't be bought - or sold
Tell me why are you people so cold I'm
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow
On Saturn
People live to be two hundred and five
Going back to Saturn where the people smile
Don't need cars cause we've learned to fly
On Saturn
Just to live to us is our natural high We have come here many times before
To find your strategy to peace is war
Killing helpless men, women and children
That don't even know what they're dying for
We can't trust you when you take a stand
With a gun and bible in your hand
And the cold expression on your face
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy Ow... Tossing and turning all night long
My girl is gone, can't take it
I'm trying to conceal the loneliness I feel
But it's real, can't fake it
The pain in my heart is tearing me apart
Her memory, can't shake it
I tried to tell myself to find somebody else
But my heart, won't make it Ah ah, I need love and that's natural fact
And more than anything I want my baby back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back) (I, want my baby back)
She's the only girl that brightens up my world
What can I say, don't make her do it
She's fine as can be and was so good to me
I had a good thing, and I blew it
Now I'm all alone, the love we had is gone
What can I do, to renew it
If I only had a chance to continue our romance
I wouldn't hestiate, to get to it Ah ah, I need love and that's natural fact
And more than anything I want my sugar back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)
Ah ah ah, ah ah yeah
(I, want my baby back) Ah ah ah, ah ah I need love and that's a natural fact
And more than anything I want my baby back
(I want my baby back)
I want her here with me
(I want my baby back)
Ah ah ah, ah ah
Ah ah I, want my baby back
My heart is aching, think it's breaking
Ah ah, ah ah I want my baby back
My world is lonely, need her only
Everybody sing I want my baby back now
(I want my baby back)
Ha ha ha, ha ha I, want my baby back
My heart is sadly... Fingertips Part 1 & 2 6:24 Trk 2

'How 'bout it?'
'Go ahead an shake this up for me real good'
'Stevie Wonder.' ~ Do do do
Do do do
Do do do I longed for you since I was born
A woman sensitive and warm
And that you were
With pride and strength no one would test
But yet have feminine finesse
And so much more You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from Heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from Heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world A female Shakespeare of your time
With looks to blow Picasso's mind
You were the best
Your body moved with grace and song
Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms
Nevertheless, oh, oh You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from Heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Ooh, you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from Heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world Da da da
Da da da
Da da da The passion burning in your heart
Would make Hell's fire seem like a spark
Where did it go?
Just why that you would overnight
Turn love to stone as cold as ice
I'll never know But you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from Heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Baby, you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from Heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world Cold, too cold, you took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from Heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
Oh, oh, oh, took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from Heaven you dropped me back
Down into this cold, cold world I would not do that to a dog Took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from Heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world
You took me riding in your rocket, gave me a star
But at a half a mile from Heaven you dropped me back
Down to this cold, cold world Ooh, baby
Rocket love My outer self looks happy as can be
A perfect dream love as clear as all can see
But just like that, real, has hit me suddenly
My outer is a liar
Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need the fire, fire, fire to keep me warm
I got to feel the fire My smiling face, with laughter on the side
You'd say no doubt I get passion every night
But if in our bed your arms don't hold me tight
Means it leaves much to be desired Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need the fire, fire, fire to keep me warm
I got to feel the fire And if you look into my eyes and you told yourself the truth
You can't make a body hot if you don't light the fuse
I need your fire, fire, fire to keep me warm
I got to feel the fire It don't take a rocket scientist to know
That if you don't fan the flame then the fire will eventually go Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need the fire, fire, fire to keep me warm
I got to feel the fire Cause when I look inside my heart and I tell the truth to me
Loud and clear my soul cries out with total honesty
I need your fire, fire, fire to keep me warm
I got to feel the fire
I need the fire, fire, fire to keep me warm
I got to feel the fire To keep me warm, I got to feel the fire Ebony and Ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we? We all know that people are the same where ever you go
There is good and bad in everyone
And we learn to live, we learn to give each other
What we need to survive together alive Ebony and Ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we? Ebony, Ivory living in pefect harmony
Ebony, Ivory, oh We all know that people are the same where ever you go
There is good and bad in everyone
We learn to live when we learn to give each other
What we need to survive together alive Ebony and Ivory live together in perfect harmony
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we?
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we? Ebony, Ivory living in pefect harmony
Ebony, Ivory living in pefect harmony
Ebony, Ivory living in pefect harmony
... Shattered dreams, worthless years
Here am I encased inside a hollow shell
Life began, then was done
Now I stare into a cold and empty well The many sounds that meet our ears
The sights our eyes behold
Will open up our merging hearts
And feed our empty souls I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever Without despair we will share
And the joys of caring will not be replaced
What has been must never end
And with the strength we have won't be erased
When the truths of love are planted firm
They won't be hard to find
And the words of love I speak to you
Will echo in my mind I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love this time it will be forever I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever
I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever God surely answered my prayer
God surely answered by prayer
You know God surely answered my prayer
You know God surely answered my prayer
God always will answer your prayers
Believe in one who will answer my prayer
Thank you God (I believe when I fall in love with you it will be forever) Come on, let's fall in love
You're the woman I've been waiting for
Come on, let's fall in love
You're the girl that I really adore
Come on, let's fall in love (don't you wanna, don't you wanna, don't you wanna fall in love with me)
Come on baby, let's fall in love
Come on let's fall in love I've always come to the conclusion that 'but' is the way
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on ones head
So I have tried to not be the one who 'll fall into that line
But what I feel inside I think you should know And baby that's you you you
Made life's his-to-ry
'Cause you've brought some joy inside my tears
And you have done what no one thought could be
You've brought some joy inside my tears I've always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid
To go past yesterday and start living for today
I feel that lasting moments are coming fr and few between
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring
Baby, baby it's you you you
Made life's history
Oh baby, you've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby you have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears You've brought some joy inside my tears
Baby, baby you have done what no one thought could be
He why, you brought some joy inside my tears
Gotta tell you
You you you made life's history
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought you brought you brought some joy inside my tears
Baby baby baby you have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears You made it baby you made it baby made it made life's his-to-ry
You you you made life's his-to-ry

Nobody ever thought it would be

Gotta shout about it baby
You brought some joy inside my tears You have done what no one thought could be
You brought some joy inside my tears
You you you made life's history
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my tears
You brought some joy inside my, tears Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more
And people falling in love is so old-fashioned
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love's passion Send her your love
With a dozen roses
Make sure that she knows it
With a flower from your heart Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's straight from the heart I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal
And can only happen in make-believe stories
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see
For around us are miracles of love's glory, hey Show him your love
Don't hold back your feelings
You don't need a reason
When it's coming from your heart Ah ah ah, ah ah ah, ah ah ah, ah
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey That girl thinks that she's so fine
That soon she'll have my mind
That girl thinks that she's so smart
That soon she'll have my heart
She thinks in no time flat
That she'll be free and clear to start
With her emotional rescued love
That you'll leave torn apart That girl thinks that she's so bad
She'll change my tears to joy from sad
She says she keeps the upper hand
'Cause she can please her man
She doesn't use her love to make him weak
She uses love to keep him strong
And inside me there's no room for doubt
That it won't be too long
Before I tell her That I love her, that I want her
That my mind, soul and body need her
Tell her that I'd love to
That I want to
That I need to do
All that I have to, to win her love
I've been hurting for a long time
And you've been playing for a long time
You know it's true
I've been holding for a long time
And you've been running for a long time
It's time to do what we have to do That girl
That girl yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah That girl knows every single man
Would ask her for her hand
But she says her love is much too deep
For them to understand
She says her love has been crying out
But her lover hasn't heard
But what she doesn't realize is that
I've listened to every word
That's why I know I'll tell her That I love her, that I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to
That I want to
That I need to do
All that I have to, to win her love Tell her I love her, that I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to
That I want to
That I need to do
All that I have to, to win her love Tell I love her, that I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to
That I want to
That I need to do
All that I have to, to win her love That I love her, that I want her
That my mind, soul and body needs her
Tell her that I'd love to
That I want to
That I need to do
All that I have to, to win her love That girl, that girl, that girl
Oh, that girl, that girl, that girl Mary wants to be a superwoman
But is that really in her head
But I just want to live each day to love her
For what she is Mary wants to be another movie star
But is that really in her mind
And all the things she wants to be
She needs to leave behind But, very well, I believe I know you very well
Wish that you knew me too-very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head Very well, and I think I can face very well
Wish that you knew me too very well
And I think I can cope with everything going through your head Mary wants to be a superwoman
And try to boss the bull around
But does she really think that she will get by with a dream My woman want to be a superwoman
And I just had to say good-bye
Because I can't spend all my hours start to cry But, very well, I believe I know you
Very well wish that you knew me too
Very well, and I think I can deal with everything going through your head Very well, think that I know you too
Very well, wish you knew me like I know you
Very well, but I think I can deal with everything going through your head Very well (dumb dumb da, dumb dumb da)
Very well, wish you knew me too
Very well, and I wish I could think of everything going through your head Very well, dumb dumb da, dumb da, dumb da
Dumb dumb da, dumb dumb da, dumb da, dumb da, very well
And I think I can deal with everything going through your head When the summer came you were not around
Now the summer's gone and love cannot be found
Where were you when I needed you last winter, my love? When the winter came you went further south
Parting from love's nest, leaving me in doubt
Where are you when I need you, like right now? Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed
But tomorrow will reflect love's past When the winter came you were not around
Through the bitter winds love could not be found
Where were you when I needed you, last winter, my love? (I need you baby, I need you baby) Our love is at an end
But you say now you have changed,
But tomorrow will reflect love's past oh Spring will fill the air and you will come around
Well is it summer love that will let me down?
Where were you when I needed you, last winter, my love? La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
Where are you when I need you, like right now?
Right now, right now, right now, oh Where were you when I needed you last winter, my dear?
Oh I know you, yeah, I need you baby, I need you baby
I need you baby, I need you baby, I need you baby, I need you baby
Oh, where were you when I needed you last winter, last winter, oh no Oh yeah, brace yourself, need you baby, need you, need you baby
Oh, you want me too need you baby
Oh where were you when I needed you last, dear

So you can make me scream So boogie on reggae woman

Fall deeply in love

Under the stars above So boogie on reggae woman

(No!) Boogie on reggae woman
What is wrong with me
Boogie on reggae woman
What you tryin' to do Boogie on reggae woman
Let me do it to you
Boogie on reggae woman
What you tryin' to do All the gold in all the world
Is nothing to posses
If all the things that it can bring
Can't add up to one ounce of your happiness
Refrain:
And for your love I would do anything
Just to see the smile upon your face
For your love i would go anywhere
Just you tell me and I'll be right there
A diamond that shines
Like a star in the sky
Is nothing to behold
For miniscule is any light
If it can't like you brighten up my soul
Refrain:
I could have never fathomed this
Such joy
love and tenderness
That you give to me
For the love I feel inside
It's so wonderful I can't hide
And i glow
I glow
With just the thought of you
I do
I do
I do
I do
I do
I do
Refrain: Whoa, oh, oh, yeah, mmm, hmm, Sylvia
You know you're getting to me now
Mmm, mmm, mmm, Sylvia
You gently touched my heart somehow Yesterday you made me happy as a child at play
Just like the summer sun that warms my heart
And move on, now you are gone Whoa, oh, oh, Sylvia, you're everything that I adore
That sweet song that caught a spark in me more
Tenderly, that's how you whisper that you loved me
As if a raindrop kissed my ear and disappeared, now you are gone Oh, oh, oh, yeah
You know I love my little Sylvia Whoa, oh, oh, yeah
And yesterday I fell in love with you all the way
Tenderly you lit a spark in my heart, now you are gone Mmm, hmm, Sylvia
I gently miss Sylvia
I'm crazy 'bout ya, Sylvia
You know I love my little Sylvia People hand in hand
Have I lived to see the milk and honey land?
Where hate's a dream and love forever stands
Or is this a vision in my mind? The law was never passed
But somehow all men feel they're truly free at last.
Have we really gone this far through space and time
Or is this a vision in my mind? I'm not one who make believes
I know that leaves are green
They only turn to brown when autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to find our wings and fly away
To the vision in our mind? I'm not one who make believes
I know that leaves are green
They only change to brown when autumn comes around
I know just what I say
Today's not yesterday
And all things have an ending But what I'd like to know
Is could a place like this exist so beautiful
Or do we have to take our wings and fly away
To the visions in our minds? Hey pretty baby with the high heels on
You give me fever like I've never ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone) I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy
Oh I'll be workin' from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keepin' you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on

You knock me off of my feet now baby

Stand for it baby
Now, baby, ah, ah Butterflies begin from having been another
As a child is born from being in a mother's womb
But how many times have you wished you were some other
someone than who you are
Yet who's to say if all were uncovered
You will like what you see
You can only be you
As I can only be me Flowers cannot bloom until it is their season
As we would not be here unless it was our destiny
But how many times have you wished to be in spaces
Time places than what you were
Yet who's to say with unfamiliar faces You could anymore be
Loving you that you see
You can only be you
As I can only be
Me I can only be me Then that's got shall get
Them that's not shall loose
So the Bible said and it still is news
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own Well the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own Money, you've got lots of friends
Crowding round your door
When it's gone and spending ends
They don't come round no more Rich relations give
Crusts of bread and such
You can help yourself
But don't take too much
Mama may have, papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own Dodo do do do dodo
Do do dodo do dodo
Dodo dodo do do Dodo do do do dodo
Do do do do dodo do
Dodo dodo dodo I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't touched the sky She's a girl in a dream
She sees a four eyed cartoon monster on the T.V. screen
She takes another puff and says "It's a crazy scene"
That red is green
And she's a tangerine I'm too high
I'm too high
But I ain't left the ground I'm too high
I'm too high
I hope I never ever come down She's the girl in her life
But her world's a superficial paradise
She had a chance to make it big more than once or twice
But no dice
She wasn't very nice Ooh Dodo do do do dodo
Do do dodo do dodo
Do do do do do do Dodo do do do dodo
Do do dodo do dodo
Dodo dodo dodo dodo dodo dodo I'm too high
I'm too high
I can't ever touch the sky I'm too high
I'm so high
I feel like I'm about to die She's a girl of the past
I guess that I got to her at last
A did you hear the news about the girl today
She passed away
What did her friend say They said she's too high
Too high
Can't hang around anyway Dodo do do do dodo
Do do dodo do dodo
Do do do
Do do do do I look inside my crystal ball of desire
And know why rapid beats my heart
I see the spark, I feel the flame of the fire
Letting me know love wants to start No more playing around, no more waiting around
For the special one to come
No more wearing a frown, no more tears coming down
'Cause I know what I want and I want what I know Is you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, it's you
You're the angel sent from heaven above
It's you Nobody has to tell me so
It's you
You're that angel sent from heaven above
For me
(Me for you and you for me) If only I had not waited
I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited
My life would be undone If only I had not waited
I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited
For you I look behind and what I sight is the mire
So very lonely was my heart
I look ahead, I hear the sound of the choir
Singing that love will never part No more hearing the sound of the rain coming down
No more I can't see the sun
No more hurting for fun 'cause the moment has come
When I know what I want and I want what I know Is you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you
You're the angel sent from heaven above
It's you Nobody has to tell me so
It's you
You're that angel sent from heaven above
For me
(Me for you and you for me) If only I had not waited
I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited
My life would be undone If only I had not waited
I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited
For you 'Cause baby it's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you
You're the angel sent from heaven above
It's you Nobody has to tell me so
It's you, it's you
You're that angel sent from heaven above
For me
(Me for you and you for me) If only I had not waited
I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited
My life would be undone If only I had not waited
I would have picked the wrong one
If only I had not waited
For you 'Cause baby it's you
Nobody has to tell me so
It's you No more lying friends
Wanting tragic ends
Though they do pretend
They won't go when I go All those bleeding hearts
With sorrows to impart
Were right here from the start
And they won't go when I go And I'll go where I've longed
To go so long
Away from tears
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Gone from painful cries
Away from saddened eyes
Along with him I'll bide
And they won't go when I go Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Big men feeling small
Weak ones standing tall
I will watch them fall
'Cause they won't go when I go
And I'll go where I've longed
To go so long
Away from tears
Unclean minds mislead the pure
The innocent will leave for sure
For them there is a resting place
People sinning just for fun
They will never see the sun
For they can never show their faces
There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner
Who will take more than he will give
He'll give, he'll give
He ain't hardly gonna give, oh yeah The greed of man will be
Far away from me
And my soul will be free
They won't go when I go
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Since my soul conceived
All that I believe
The kingdom I will see
'Cause they won't go when I go
And I'll go
Where I'll go
No one can keep me
From my destiny, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
They won't go when I go There are people who have let the problems of today
Lead them to conclude that for them life is not the way
But every problem has an answer and if your's you cannot find
You should talk it over to Him
He'll give you peace of mind
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God Many of us feel we walk alone without a friend
Never communicating with the One who lives within
Forgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down
And you can talk to him anytime He's always around
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God Well He's the only free psychiatrist that's known throughout the world
For solving the problems of all men, women, little boys and girls
When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God When you feel your life's too hard
Just go have a talk with God
When your load's too much to bear
Just go talk to God He cares Baby, I knew at once
That you were meant for me
Deep in my soul I know
That you're my destiny Though you're unsure
Why fight the tide?
Don't think so much
Let your heart decide Baby, I see your future
And it's tied to mine
I look in your eyes
And see you searching for a sign But you'll never fall
'Til you let go
Don't be so scared
Of what you don't know True to your heart
You must be true to your heart
That's when the heavens will part
And baby, shower you with my love Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies
And when you're true to your heart
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me
Hit the basement, remix Someone you know is on your side
Can set you free
I can do that for you
If you believe in me Why second-guess?
What feels so right?
Just trust your heart
And you'll see the light True to your heart
You must be true to your heart
That's when the heavens will part
And baby, shower you with my love Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies
And when you're true to your heart
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me You know it's true
Your heart knows what's good for you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah You know it's true
It'll see you through, yeah, yeah
Clap your hands, stomp your feet Boy, my heart is driving me to where you are
You can take both hands off the wheel and still get far
Be swept away and enjoy the ride
You won't get lost, yeah, with your heart to guide you True to your heart
You must be true to your heart
That's when the heavens will part
And baby, shower you with my love Open your eyes
Your heart can tell you no lies
And when you're true to your heart
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me
To me, to me I know it's gonna lead you straight to me
Put a smile on your face, come on
I know it's gonna lead you straight to me, yeah In 1492 you came upon these shores.
Seven hundred years, educated by the moors;
17th Century-- genocide and the gun
Middle Passage blessed to market the Africans. In the so-called ""Land of God""
My kind were treated hard.
From back then until now
I see, and you agree--
We have been a misrepresented people. From back then until now
Just see my family tree;
We have been a misrepresented people.
We have been a misrepresented people. 19th century-- slavery destroyed.
Soldiers who fought and won
What''s known as ""nigger-boys"".
20th century-- with freedom in my hand,
We invent ideas
Which helped us save a land, But while I prayed to God
My moms and pops got whored.
From back then until now
You''ll see our history;
We have been a misrepresented people. From back then until now
Just see my family tree;
We have been a misrepresented people
Yes, we have been a misrepresented people. 1969-- Black power's at the door.
1982-- Hop-hop was on the floor.
1992-- Gangsta crack prevailed.
1999-- Our colors filled the jails. It is through the grace of God
That we all were not scarred.
From back then until now
We see no comedy;
We have been a misrepresented people. From back then until now
Were we still a mystery;
We have been a misrepresented people.
Yes, we have been a misrepresented people. Though we march across time,
A sea of victories,
We have been a misrepresented people. From back then until now
You know we made you grow;
We have been a misrepresented people.
We have been a misrepresented people. From back then until now
We see our destiny
To never be a misrepresented people. Yes, we march across to time to free
A melody
To never be a misrepresented people. No you must never be a misrepresented people. [Thanks to emergentsea@hotmail.com for lyrics] Try to see things my way
Do I have to keep on talking
Till I can't go on? While you see it your way
Run the risk of knowing
That our love may soon be gone We can work it out
We can work it out Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong
And still you think that it's alright Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight
Or say good night We can work it out
We can work it out Life is very short
And there's no time
For fussing and fighting, my friend I have always thought
That it's a crime
So I will ask you once again Try to see things my way
Only time will tell
If I am right or I am wrong While you see it your way
There's a chance
That we might fall apart
Before too long We can work it out
We can work it out We can work it out
We can work it out
We can work it out Try to see things my way
Only time will tell
If I am right or I am wrong While you see it your way
There's a chance
That we may fall apart
Before too long We can work it out
We can work it out Think of what you're saying
You can get it wrong
And still you think that it's alright Think of what I'm saying
We can work it out and get it straight
Or say good night We can work it out
We can work it out
We can work it out
We can work it out
We can work it out And if you really love me, won't you tell me? Yeah
(And if you really love me, won't you tell me?)
And if you really love me, won't you tell me? Yeah
Then I won't have to be playing around You call my name, oh so sweet
To make your kiss incomplete
When your mood is clear
You quickly change your ways
Then you say I'm untrue
What am I supposed to do
Be a fool who sits alone waiting for you But if you really love me won't you tell me? Yeah
(But if you really love me won't you tell me?)
And if you really love me won't you tell me? Yeah
Then I won't have to be playing around I see the light of your smile
Calling me all the while
You are saying baby
"It's time to go"
First the feeling's alright
Then it's gone from sight
So I'm taking out this time to say Oh, if you really love me, won't you tell me? Yeah
(Oh, if you really love me, won't you tell me?)
And if you really love me, won't you tell me? Baby tell me
Then I won't have to be playing around, no
Playing around no Hey yeah
Goofin' around no
Oh baby
Playing around no
Let me know how you feel, baby
Hey oh baby
Playing around no You make me smile
You make me sing
You make me feel good everything
You bring me up
When I've been down
This only happens when you're around And I can't go on this way
With it stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you I want to fly
Away with you
Until there's nothing more for us to do
I want to be
More than a friend
Until the end of an endless end And I can't go on this way
With it stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you
